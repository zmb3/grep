grep
====

A simple grep-like tool implemented in Go.

This was done for 2 reasons:

1) It was a nice exercise to write some Go code.
2) I could actually benefit from having this functionality on Windows.

As such, it only contains features that I found useful or felt like building.  
It does not support regular expressions and its feature set is lacking compared to something like GNU grep.
